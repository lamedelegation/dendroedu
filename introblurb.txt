Henri Grissino-Mayer's web site, formerly at <http://web.utk.edu/~grissino/>,
used to be a convenient place to which we could direct anyone asking for
background information about dendrochronology (particularly for those of us too
lazy to assemble our own web content). However its demise is an opportunity for
a fresh start in providing dendrochronological web resources, even if the
University of Tennessee restores it in some form, or Henri rebuilds it
elsewhere.

Ideally, this resource would not be dependent on any one individual or
institution, and would be a stable long-term source of information about
dendrochronology for a general Internet-wide audience. It wouldn't be a trivial
undertaking, requiring the work of a broad community of content editors as well
as web site builders and system administrators (and almost certainly some source
of continuing funding, even if it was run by volunteers). So I'm sending an
early draft proposal to discover if there would be any community interest in
starting such a project.

The proposal is deliberately vague about the concrete technical details: the
first priority would be finding enough people sharing a consensus about the
content to be provided and the editorial workflow needed to publish it. But in
practice nothing elaborate would be needed, just one of the common content
management systems like Wordpress or Drupal, and some CDN services.
